## Meal Plan Generator
Make your weekly meal planning simpler! This application provides you with four choices per meal. Version 1 allows you to create a weekly meal plan consisting of 3 recipes per breakfast, lunch, or dinner choice, so you have a variety of meals for the week. For each meal, users will choose between a set of recipes for the specific meal. These recipes' ingredients are then compiled together to create a grocery list for reference. The application utilizes the [spoonacular api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). It is a rich backend containing parameters to specify timeFrame, targetCalories, diet, restrictions, and images to references to cater to wellness enthusiasts' and professionals' preferences.
For version 2: I plan to implement the following:
  - save feature to save current and historic plans, utilizing OAuth for authentication
  - search feature to find specfic recipes
  - favorites feature
  - includes dietary restrictions
